dnsproxy2 - a replacement DNS proxy for Android 4.3+

This currently allows the user to manually override the DNS server IP,
and it sets the correct UID on outbound requests so they can be filtered
via iptables / AFWall+ / DroidWall / etc.

Support load DNS addresses from file:

    dnsproxy2 -w dns_list_file.ext &

DNS list file format:

    IP1 | IP2 | ...

Build instructions:

1) Install NDK r15c under %DEV_ROOT%\android\ndk

3) Binaries are under bin/. (Precompiled binaries are under there.)
