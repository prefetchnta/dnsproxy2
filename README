dnsproxy2 - a replacement DNS proxy for Android 4.3+

This currently allows the user to manually override the DNS server IP,
and it sets the correct UID on outbound requests so they can be filtered
via iptables / AFWall+ / DroidWall / etc.


Build instructions:

1) Install NDK under %DEV_ROOT%\android\ndk

2) Run src/ndk-arm7.bat

3) Binaries are under src/.
